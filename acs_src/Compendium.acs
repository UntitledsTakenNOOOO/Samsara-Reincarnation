			\n\n- Smooth animations skews the damage of Doomguy's weapons overall higher, although it's still randomized. Turning on vanilla animations enables vanilla damage.
			\n\n- The Fist no longer alerts monsters, because that was stupid.
			\n\n- Doomguy never had to deal with ghosts. In Heretic and HeXen, the Shotgun, Super Shotgun, and Chaingun pass harmlessly through ghosts.

			\n\n- All of Chexter's weapons are slightly more accurate (from bullet spread of 5.6 to 4) to differentiate them from Doomguy's, and to make up for the lack of an SSG.

			\n\n- The Firemace was incredibly underwhelming as an ultimate weapon. It has been moved to a slot II weapon, rather than VII.
			\n\n- The Firemace uses less ammo, shooting four balls for every one ammo. This is to differentiate it from the Dragon Claw.
			\n\n- The tomed Dragon Claw and Hellstaff use less ammo--this is to tempt players away from just tomed Firemacing everything.
			\n\n- The Staff and Gauntlets of the Necromancer no longer lower and re-raise when the Tome of Power runs out, so as to smooth out gameplay.
			\n\n- The Gauntlets of the Necromancer and Tomed Staff now have GLDefs, because pretty.
			\n\n- The tomed Dragon Claw fires a near-hitscan now, rather than a very fast projectile. Giving it slower speeds glitched the rippers and caused them to go all over the map.

Reports said the people responsible are the long missing banjo artists, Billy Ray Jeter and the Old Coot, in spite of numerous reports that the two men have been killed numerous times. Scientists say that the dead Billy Rays and Old Coots must have been clones, and the unkillable ones are the genuine article.\n\n\"We believe banjo music and alien experimentation are responsible.\" Dr. Lewis Smart, a professor at Arkansas Middle School explained. \"They must have performed some experiment that causes banjo music to kill off the aging cells. It's all very scientific and complicated. You really need a degree or two to understand it.\" \n\nThe explanation provided little consolation to the sleepless townsfolk. \"That Billy Ray's a traitor!\" One angry townsman was quoted as saying. \"He used to be in a jug band, and now he's gone banjo on us! He done a damn sell out job on us jug music fans! Next thing you know, he'll be headlining Hollerpolooza And to add insult t' injury, now I just gones and wasted my best buckshot on 'im, and I still can't nail his ass. And now they is gone and said that banjo music is making him too tough for my rifle! Shiiiyit! Life ain't fair.\" \n\nSome scientists dispute the banjo theory, saying that the reason that Billy Ray and the Old Coot can't be killed are because of secret experiments by the evil Xatrix Corporation, which mistook Billy Ray and the Old Coot for videogame characters, and since videogame characters can't really be killed, neither can Billy Ray or the Old Coot. Xatrix was not available for comment. \n\nBilly Ray and the Old Coot were last seen heading in the direction of Hickston.", "RRBANJO" },

			\n ^- Additionally, unique characteristics have been added to some of the Demoness's weapons.
			\n\n- The strength, intelligence, wisdom, and dexterity stat were static, but given that the Demoness levels up it made more sense to allow these stats to also grow.

			\n\n- The acid rune never had radius damage. Because doubling the damage of the weapon was too low, a stacking poison damage has been added to the projectile when it hits a target, and will leave a weak, small cloud that hurts enemies.
			\n\n- The powered acid rune missile does 50% more damage than in the original. 
			\n\n- The Tempest staff projectile does enough damage now to compensate for being a slot 7 with it's slow rate of fire.
			\n\n- The Tempest staff lightning chain is also now capable of chaining to more enemies to be more effective at clearing crowds given it's a powered BFG slot weapon.

After his first fight with Nemesis, he finds his foe under a large cemetary in the Towne of Morbidity and follows Nemesis across space and time to thwart his plans of dominating the universe. After finally vanquishing Nemesis for good in the present day and his cybernetic form in the Far Future, Petton joins the Wheel of Samsara in hopes of intervening in the vile machinations of Nemesis (or those like him), to defend the people of Thoria yet again.", ""},
			
			{ "Traits", "As old school as it gets: Everhail comes from the extremely archaic infancy of First Person Shooter design, and as such weapon design wasn't quite what it would become later. Everhail has mastered the Magic Missile, and perhaps out of stubborness refuses to use anything else. Instead relying on magical artifacts that give supplementary benefits to the Magic Missile, Petton does not abide by the same weapon design as other heroes. Simply picking up ammo gives these artifacts. You do not need to find Slot pickups to use them.
			\n\nToo Hot to Handle: The projectiles Petton shoots aren't very fast, and the damage of his artifacts (while high) are very unfocused. However, using Secondary fire, Petton players can charge their magic missile up to 300% and utilize an artifact, releasing often times devastating damage on their enemies.
			\n\nWarrior's Blood: The Catacomb games were rather easy even on their hardest difficulty, especially compared to later games like Doom. Petton had no issue shrugging off dozens of fireballs and plasma shots, and even when he would take a lot of damage he could hoard tons of potions. As such, Petton wears an enchanted cloak that give generous protection to most elemental attacks, particularly fire, and can carry far more potions than any other class with portable healing items. However, he still takes normal damage from attacks types that didn't exist in his primitive engine, such as Bullets, Poison, and non-elemental explosives.", ""},
			
			{ "Changes", "- Catacomb 3D attacks often did only 1 damage, 3 at most. Most enemies had HP in the single digits. It seemed to make sense to multiply all damage values by 10.
			\n\n- In the Catacomb games, the player had to tap the attack key continously to fire. This could result in repetative stress when more durable enemies showed up, so to take it easy on you we made it so you can hold the attack button to fire continuously at a decent rate of fire.
			\n\n- In Catacomb 3D, the player could hold down the attack button instead of tapping to charge up a fireball (3X Damage) Spell. Here, however, charging is done with secondary, is much faster, can be chained with artifacts, and can be released early for 2X damage instead.
			\n\n- In the Catacomb Adventure Trilogy, Petton had a crystal ball radar that could upgraded to detect more enemies by picking up gems. Since we can't add a radar like that for technical reasons, the gems are instead worn as rings the give the player temporary buffs.
			\n\n- Due to the primitive nature of the Catacomb games, the Petton Everhail class has a far greater number of original weapons made for him than perhaps any other class in Samsara. Only his Pistol, slot 2, slot 4, and slot 7 are actual items in the Catacomb games. The rest were made up for Samsara.
