- Flaregun primary now deals about 42 damage over the course of its lifetime instead of 70.
- TNT Bundles control like they did in Blood. Primary hold and release throws the TNT, Secondary ignites the fuse.

StrifeGuy:

- Added Blackbird radio chatter in the form of taunts
- Implemented the Gas Grenades that were cut from the final product. They work similarly to White Phosphorus grenades, but deal poison damage and don't creep slowly around surfaces. The damage output is very high, even higher than WP grenades, but they cannot effect robots and deal half-damage to cyborgs and creatures made of slime.
- Buffed Mini-Missiles to deal 50% more explosion damage and an impact deals a solid 40 damage in addition to the explosion.

- Electric Crossbow, Flamethrower, and Mauler deal double damage.
- Bullets deal 4 1d3 damage, true to source. The Pistol shoots much faster.
- Poison Bolts deal 50 1d4 damage to enemies it can effect, allowing it to pick up the slack when Strifeguy runs out of rockets.
- Electric Bolts now deal double damage to all Robotic, Cybernetic, or Vehicular enemies across the entire monster mixer. Enemies made of slime or liquid, such as the Muck Demoness from Witchaven, also take double damage. Robotic and Vehicular enemies, as well as ghostly enemies and enemies made of stone, are immune to poison bolts. Cyborg enemies take half damage from Poison Bolts.

Space Seal:

- Mines can blow up their user in DM, but are also shootable
- Mines can be destroyed with explosives in all game modes
- Space Seal's weapons deal slightly higher damage in DM, as Corridor 7 was one of the first games to have dedicated Deathmatch mode with it own maps, predating Rise of the Triad by a few months. Made sense knowing this fun fact to have Space Seal be the dedicated DM beginner class.
- The Alien Plasma Rifle increases in damage as the projectile travels, and on a direct hit the damage, whatever it is, is dealt in full.
- Alien Plasma Rifle fires slightly slower and only consumes 1 rocket instead of 2.
- The screen briefly flashes red when the Alien Disintigrator is fired.

Space Seal is the closest to an "authentic" Wolf 3d-style damage system. BJ's weapon damage increases in close range as well, but only slightly.

LDF Commando:

- Class was almost completely overhauled. All projectiles use the same speed values from source, so they are lightning fast. Projectile damage also uses the same values from source, but most had to be either doubled or increased slightly due to the extremely low damage scale.

Samsara_ExtraHeroesv1.1 (Yeah, no more Samsara Addons).

This contains:

- Better player & pickup sprites for Eleena.
- C7 Class slot 4 speed work as in original game.
- Tried to rebalance (duh) Caleb (Jezz, hes impossible to balance...)
- Some other minor fixes.
- *Added C7 class a HUD (HUD made by BouncTEM / the mugshot frames are from the Corridor 7 TC, all credit's goes to their respective authors)
- *The C7 HUD was polished (I made some graphics, edited the statusbar, mugshots & weaponbar)
- Added a HUD for Strifeguy (The graphics were made by The_Riet).
- IPFreely now has a statusbar. (At least it doesnt have the ugly no-clipping messed look anymore, {Is this some kind-of-like coop bar from original Rott?})
- Added friendly monster for IPFreely (Low Guard used from Return of the Triad (Credit's goes to ELZEE & Respective Authors, some extra attack, sight, death, etc.
									   sounds were used from the Rott goddies pack (credit's goes to respective authors & Apooge; also, i made the full firing rotation frames.))) 
- Better weapon 3 sprites for Blake Stone (Sprites made by Dynamo).
- Added friendly monster for Eleena (Monster frames & some projectiles ripped by Diodeus, i ripped the rest graphics and sounds (God, rip sprites from Eradicator is a REALLY BIG TORTURE)).
- Added friendly monster for SpaceSeal. (i made the full firing rotation frames; Graphics & sight sound taken from the Corridor 7 TC, i recorded the firing & death sounds too (Thanks for the tip BouncyTEM))
- Added friendly monster for Caleb (Sprites, code, etc. are from IvanDobrovski's ZBlood X Addon).
- Added friendly monster for Blake Stone (i made the full firing rotation frames; Graphics & sounds taken from the Blake Stone Demo TC, all credit's goes to their respective authors).
- The Blake Stone HUD was edited (it isnt that taller as before).
- Added friendly monster for StrifeGuy. (Made by Gardevoir)
- Eleena now has a HUD.
- Caleb now has an upper bar (i made & edited some of the graphics).
- Some weapon effects for Caleb were polished (Code used from the ZBlood X addon by IvanDobrovski).
  
* Note 1: Punchdrunk isnt made yet because im out of time.

* Note 2: Im trying to fill every missing thing, so i wish that this
		  wont feel incomplete anymore. (Please, check Note 1*)

* Note 3: I hope that this is compatible with Hexen & Strife (wew) now.  
 
* Note 4: The Eradicator addon could have a lot of better effects & visual things, but some of the required graphics 
		  were just impossible to rip.
	
* Note 5: Tipboxes for Strifeguy and Eleena will be included in the next version of this.

* Note 6: If something isnt working well, please let me know! (Any feedback will be appreciated too!)
