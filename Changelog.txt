----------------------Reincarnation 1.0--------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Added extra pickup messages for every class, and included the setting in the options menu.
- Coop no longer uses invisible fast projectiles in place of hitscan bullet attacks.

- Baratus takes less damage when near enemies, while Daedolon takes less damage while away from enemies. Parias regenerates armor of nearby allies.
- The new Hexen classes have their own mugshots, but they are currently not implemented due to mugshot switching not being possible with SBARInfo.
- Restored missing automap hud
- Fixed Serpent staff not blinking
- Parias' Serpent Staff will no longer heal him when using it on a blocking enemy
- Sapphire staff no longer alerts enemies

Security Officer:

so reloading these is a little faster
- fixed some sprite naming conflicts that some of SecOff weapons would cause

- Buffed Ranger's shotgun and double shotgun to deal 5 damage per pellet (30 total for single shotgun, 70 total for Double)

- Fixed the Ranger's godmode mugshot looking wrong in Zandronum

- Added Freeley's H.U.N.T Comrades, along with their extra stats
- Heatseeker and Bazooka have swapped positions and ammo types.
- RoTT Bullets deal their original damage values instead of Doom ones (13 for the pistols, 10 for the MP40)
- RoTT Missiles deal their original damage of 50, with some exceptions (Drunk Missiles only do 25, and most rockets have contact damage in SP and Coop modes.)

Blake Stone:

- Added an Aliens of Gold alt class.

- Most Blake Stone weapons deal higher damage. For example, instead of the RAW dealing 6 1d3 damage, it now deals 7 1d3.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon now spawn explosive effects on enemies effected by the blast. These effects are damaging, making these two weapons somewhat akin to the BFG9000 from Doom.
- Plasma Discharge Unit consumes only 1 rocket instead of 2.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon had their Rate of Fire greatly increased. However, the Plasma Discharge suffered a significant range and damage decrease and the Anti-Plasma Cannon is rather innaccurate.
- The Charge Pack was moved to unique slot, while the Slot 1 is now an Auto-Charge Pistol upgrade. Xylan Orb was commented out due to not being very helpful, and not making sense for a "Skirmisher" character.
- Blake Stone gains slightly more ammo from ammo pickups

Doom64Guy:

- Is now an Altclass
- Vanilla Doom CVar has the same effect on Doom64Guy's weapon damage, although Plasma Rifle and SSG are still unaffected. Although there are no Smooth firing animations for Doom 64 guns yet, there eventually will be.

Caleb:

- Added option for Blood Guns Akimbo to be an inventory item with a cooldown or to have original behavior. It's an inventory item by default
- Added an option for Guns Akimbo to be permanent and activated at the push of a button.
- All weapons use different damage values, thanks to the NBlood source code. Some of these damage values were tweaked, however.
- Flaregun altfire deals way less damage (80-120 damage assuming all projectiles connect, instead of 152-208+80), but uses less ammo (3 vs 8)
- Flaregun primary now deals about 42 damage over the course of its lifetime instead of 70.
- TNT Bundles control like they did in Blood. Primary hold and release throws the TNT, Secondary ignites the fuse.

- Blood Explosions have a rapidly expanding sphere of radius thrust. In other words, they have a lot more knock-back.
- Sawed-Off, Tommy Gun, and Life Leech Sentry now fire faster.
- Sawed-Off is now significantly more accurate and fires 15 pellets per barrel rather than 10. Each pellet deals 5 damage for a total of 75 damage per barrel, instead of dealing about the same damage as the Super Shotgun.
- Tommy Gun deals 9 damage per shot instead of 2-4 1d3
- Napalm Rockets do 50-100 damage plus 200 damage across a radius of 150, instead 10-12 plus 82 damage over a radius of 160.

StrifeGuy:

- Added Blackbird radio chatter in the form of taunts
- Implemented the Gas Grenades that were cut from the final product. They work similarly to White Phosphorus grenades, but deal poison damage and don't creep slowly around surfaces. The damage output is very high, even higher than WP grenades, but they cannot effect robots and deal half-damage to cyborgs and creatures made of slime.
- Buffed Mini-Missiles to deal 50% more explosion damage and an impact deals a solid 40 damage in addition to the explosion.
- Strifeguy's starting accuracy and stamina upgrades were combined.
- Strifeguy no longer loses upgrades when respawning in multiplayer.

- Rebels now attack enemy players in Deathmatch, awarding the Strifeguy that spawned them with the kills they get.
- Electric Crossbow, Flamethrower, and Mauler deal double damage.
- Bullets deal 4 1d3 damage, true to source. The Pistol shoots much faster.
- Poison Bolts deal 50 1d4 damage to enemies it can effect, allowing it to pick up the slack when Strifeguy runs out of rockets.
- Electric Bolts now deal double damage to all Robotic, Cybernetic, or Vehicular enemies across the entire monster mixer. Enemies made of slime or liquid, such as the Muck Demoness from Witchaven, also take double damage. Robotic and Vehicular enemies, as well as ghostly enemies and enemies made of stone, are immune to poison bolts. Cyborg enemies take half damage from Poison Bolts.
- Strife weapons are overall much more accurate, making accuracy upgrades feel more impactful when you get them.
- Strife Flamethrower increases range with more accuracy upgrades.
- Strife Flamethrower has half the recoil and the fireballs shoot more straight at higher accuracies rather than lobbing further
- Strife Sigil's 4th mode (the homing one) now fires 5 homing shots at once
- Strife Sigil can now switch fire modes with secondary attack

- Kyle Katarn's fist now pierces armor
- StormTrooper Rifle now uses clip ammo instead of a shell for every 3 shots, and does more damage.

- Katarn's unique now has a proper class-based pickup sprite
- fixed the Thermal Detonators generating blood decals on their own

Space Seal:

- Mines can blow up their user in DM, but are also shootable
- Mines can be destroyed with explosives in all game modes
- Space Seal's weapons deal slightly higher damage in DM, as Corridor 7 was one of the first games to have dedicated Deathmatch mode with it own maps, predating Rise of the Triad by a few months. Made sense knowing this fun fact to have Space Seal be the dedicated DM beginner class.
- The Alien Plasma Rifle increases in damage as the projectile travels, and on a direct hit the damage, whatever it is, is dealt in full.
- Alien Plasma Rifle fires slightly slower and only consumes 1 rocket instead of 2.
- The screen briefly flashes red when the Alien Disintigrator is fired.
- Alien Disintegrator now fires up to 100 tracers at 16 damage each, slightly improving its killing power at mid range
- all C7-related projectile actors have NODAMAGETHRUST, knockback wasn't a thing in the Wolf 3d engine
- all C7 bullet weapons deal higher damage at closer ranges, with the possible damage either doubling or tripling at point blank. However, damage is heavily randomized and very inconsistent. Space Seal is the closest to an "authentic" Wolf 3d-style damage system. BJ's weapon damage increases in close range as well, but only slightly.

LDF Commando:

- Class was almost completely overhauled. All projectiles use the same speed values from source, so they are lightning fast. Projectile damage also uses the same values from source, but most had to be either doubled or increased slightly due to the extremely low damage scale.
- LDF Commando now starts with 50 clips.

- Subestron Arm pierces everything, regardless of ripper level.
- Subestron Arm projectiles deal approx. 180 damage for every 1/5th a second it remains inside an enemy instead of 40-50. This is enough DPS to nearly kill an Arachnotron in one shot
- Estron Projectile has 115 speed instead of 65

- Toxic Mutant Gun is no longer the slot 1, instead being Experiment's starting pistol. The slot 1 is now another random item generator (for now.)
- Overhauled IPOG weapon damage, basing it on the source code. Because the damage scale in IPOG was rather high, the damage of nearly every weapon had to cut in half.
- Mooman now uses his own pistol instead of the Cyborg's
- Plasma Shotgun deals 25 damage per bolt for a total of 125 damage instead of 13-17 for a total of 65-85

- Random Item Generators grant 5 timebombs, mines, or grenades at a time instead of only 1. You can also carry all your grenades between levels.
- IPOG Rocket does 25 damage and bursts into a ring of 20 fireballs around it, each dealing 25 damage themselves.
- Grenades, Mines, and Timebombs work similarly except they fire 28 fireballs around the blast zone.
- Laser Beams now deal a solid 30 damage instead of 26-30.
- Plasma Annihilator now deals 200 damage per beam instead of 180.
- Implemented IPOG blood
- All IPOG projectiles and puffs create IPOG blood when hitting bleeding enemies
- Made IPOG projectiles not use additive rendering. This wasn't a thing in the original game so I dunno why it was added here
- IPOG Shield Charge now offers protection from all damage
- IPOG clones now transfer the correct player color and altclass
