Scientists say that the dead Billy Rays and Old Coots must have been clones, and the unkillable ones are the genuine article.\n\n\"We believe banjo music and alien experimentation are responsible.\" Dr. Lewis Smart, a professor at Arkansas Middle School explained. \"They must have performed some experiment that causes banjo music to kill off the aging cells. It's all very scientific and complicated. You really need a degree or two to understand it.\" \n\nThe explanation provided little consolation to the sleepless townsfolk. \"That Billy Ray's a traitor!\" One angry townsman was quoted as saying. \"He used to be in a jug band, and now he's gone banjo on us! He done a damn sell out job on us jug music fans! Next thing you know, he'll be headlining Hollerpolooza And to add insult t' injury, now I just gones and wasted my best buckshot on 'im, and I still can't nail his ass. And now they is gone and said that banjo music is making him too tough for my rifle! Shiiiyit! Life ain't fair.\" \n\nSome scientists dispute the banjo theory, saying that the reason that Billy Ray and the Old Coot can't be killed are because of secret experiments by the evil Xatrix Corporation, which mistook Billy Ray and the Old Coot for videogame characters, and since videogame characters can't really be killed, neither can Billy Ray or the Old Coot. Xatrix was not available for comment. \n\nBilly Ray and the Old Coot were last seen heading in the direction of Hickston.", "RRBANJO" },

As such, Petton wears an enchanted cloak that give generous protection to most elemental attacks, particularly fire, and can carry far more potions than any other class with portable healing items. However, he still takes normal damage from attacks types that didn't exist in his primitive engine, such as Bullets, Poison, and non-elemental explosives.", ""},

			\n\n- In the Catacomb games, the player had to tap the attack key continously to fire. This could result in repetative stress when more durable enemies showed up, so to take it easy on you we made it so you can hold the attack button to fire continuously at a decent rate of fire.
			\n\n- In Catacomb 3D, the player could hold down the attack button instead of tapping to charge up a fireball (3X Damage) Spell. Here, however, charging is done with secondary, is much faster, can be chained with artifacts, and can be released early for 2X damage instead.

Golden Cards can be used only once per level, and Silver Cards can work continuously throughout the level. \n\nThe Tarot Card menu can be accessed by pressing the second class unique key.

To exit the Black Tarot screen and return to the game, press the second class unique key again. \n\nWhen you place a card on the Black Tarot board, you are making a request of a higher power to grant you the ability or bonus described on the card. Placing cards on the board costs you money - which is where the Gold comes in. Gold coins are dropped from slain enemies along with their souls. Gather as much gold as you can because, without it, your Tarot cards are essentially useless. If you do not have enough Gold to place a card, the information box informs you of this when you attempt to do so.

This removes the acceleration and deceleration from their movement, just like in their original games. Currently, this setting doesn't work well with scripted or underwater levels, so if Doom-based movement is desired or compatibility issues arise, the setting can be disabled at any time. Note that this setting won't have any affect if 'Ban Wolfenstein Style Movement' is enabled by the server." },
		{ "Wolfenstein Style View Bobbing", "If both 'Wolfenstein Style Movement' and this setting are enabled, certain classes such as Blake Stone or Space Seal will have weapon bobbing. By default, this setting is set to 'Off'." },
		{ "Weapon Animations", "This setting enables certain weapons to either have their vanilla sprites or smooth animations. It's up to the user if they want smooth weapons or not, but the default value is set to 'Off'." },
		{ "Weapon HUD Bar", "This option toggles the extended weapon bar at the top of the screen, allowing users to see which weapons they have at hand. This setting is highly recommended for multiplayer sessions, as it gives the user info about their current loadout." },
		{ "Legacy Fullscreen HUD", "Some classes such as Gordon Freeman have unique fullscreen HUDs that closely resemble their source games. If this option is enabled, they will use the standard fullscreen HUD like everyone else." },
		{ "HUD Team Text Indicator", "On team-based gamemodes, there will usually be HUD elements that show what team the player is on. If this setting is enabled, there will be text on the bottom right of the HUD showing what team the player is on." },
		{ "Pickup Graphics", "This option influences the graphics used for pickups. The options are:\n\n\cjOld-Style: \cmThis setting was used for very early versions of Samsara. Setting it to this will only display weapon slot numbers for the pickups.\n\n\cjHybrid: \cmDisplays the actual weapon pickup along with the weapon slot numbers. This is the default setting.\n\n\cjClass-Specific: \cmThis setting displays the actual pickup sprite or model by the class. This is what you'd see in the source game." },
		{ "Pickup Message Mode", "This option toggles whether to print the pickup messages for weapons or simply log them just like any other pickup message. It's highly recommended to leave this setting to 'Log'." },
		{ "Secret Discovery Notifications", "This option determines if finding a secret area should alert the user as per standard ZDoom behavior or if they don't show up. This option doesn't have an effect if the ZDoom secret notifications setting is enabled, as that setting is prioritized over this setting." },
		{ "Extra Pickup Messages", "Need a bit of variety with your weapon pickup messages? This option toggles whether to display extra pickup messages for each weapon, usually with a comedic tone." },
		{ "Pickup and Weapon Flashes", "This option toggles if Samsara's weapon pickups and items create screen flashes just like in regular Doom. Note that this setting only works for Samsara's pickups, as it doesn't affect other pickups like keys and custom megawad content. Your options are:\n\n\cjNone: \cmThis setting is the default option and has both pickup and weapon flashes.\n\n\cjPickup Flashes Disabled: \cmThis setting has the pickup flashes disabled for Samsara's powerups and item pickups.\n\n\cjWeapon Flashes Disabled: \cmThis setting disables the flashes that certain weapon could generate such as the Doom 64 version of Doomguy's B.F.G. 9000.\n\n\cjBoth Flashes Disabled: \cmThis setting disables both the pickup and weapon flashes. This setting can be helpful for those with visual epilepsy." },
		{ "Additive Pickups", "This option toggles whether to use additive rendering for health, armor, and powerups." },
		{ "Character Talk", "Certain characters are able to make comments and talk like in their source game. Actions such as killing an enemy, entering a level, picking up a weapon, and seeing a boss can trigger the characters to talk, although some are more talkative than others. If this option is disabled, the characters will stay completely silent, apart from use, pain, and death sounds, just like other characters. The characters that can talk are Duke Nukem, Caleb, Strifeguy (Blackbird will be the one talking), Eleena Brynstaarl, Lo Wang, Jon, and Leonard." },
		{ "Character Idle Talk", "If the player is standing without doing any action, certain talkative characters will talk on their own, usually about the player's idleness. If this option is turned off, the characters will stay silent when idle, but otherwise continue to talk normally. This affects Duke Nukem, Caleb, and Leonard." },
		{ "Weapon Recoil", "This option toggles whether the player should be able to experience vertical weapon recoil, which is used for classes such as Ranger or Freeman. Certain weapons may still shift the player's horizontal view, but this setting should entirely disable the vertical view changes when firing a weapon. Note that if freelook is disabled, then weapon recoil will also be disabled." },
		{ "Weapon Recoil Type", "This option controls whether the vertical weapon recoil's downward movement should use a parabola or a sine wave." },

		{ "Reloading", "This option controls how the reload mechanics of certain weapons should function. The options are:\n\n\cjOff (Including Single Shot Magazines): \cmWeapons will never have to be reloaded, instead taking reserve ammo directly when fired. Weapons that normally have single shot magazines will not need to do their reload animations.\n\n\cjOff (Excluding Single Shot Magazines): \cmThis setting is identical to the Off (Including Single Shot Magazines) setting, with an added change being that weapons that normally have single shot magazines will need to do their reload animations to maintain balance.\n\n\cjOn (Classic): \cmWeapons will have reload mechanics based on their users' original games.\n\n\cjOn (Modern): \cmAny weapon with a reload mechanic can be reloaded with the Reload button. Weapons with more than one reload mechanic can be reloaded by holding the Reload button and pressing either the Fire or Secondary Fire buttons. If a weapon loads ammo individually instead of all at once, it can be fired during its reload animation once the ammo is loaded. This is the default setting." },
		{ "Bottomless Magazines", "This option controls whether reloadable weapons (including those with single shot magazines) should not take magazine ammo while under the effects of infinite ammo. This has no effect if reloading is disabled." },

The options are:\n\n\cjOff: \cmWeapons will never overheat from continuous fire.\n\n\cjOn (Without Infinite Ammo): \cmWeapons will overheat from continuous fire unless infinite ammo is active.\n\n\cjOn (Always): \cmWeapons will overheat from continuous fire, even if infinite ammo is active. This is the default setting." },

		{ "Pistol Start", "Feeling cocky? This setting will clear the player's inventory the next time they enter a map and have them start with their default loadout. This is recommended to use for mapsets that demand that the player have a fresh inventory at the start of each map. Note that this setting doesn't work in Hexen: Beyond Heretic or Strife: Quest for the Sigil due to their non-linear style of gameplay. The options are:\n\n\cjOff: \cmPistol start will be disabled.\n\n\cjOn (Excluding Experience): At the start of every map, the player will have their inventory wiped, although classes with experience mechanics such as Grondoval will keep their gained experience.\n\n\cjOn (Including Experience): \cmAt the start of every map, the player will have their inventory completely wiped, including any experience for classes that use them." },

		{ "Increasing Ammo Capacities", "If you need to carry more ammo without changing the default ammo values, you can toggle this setting to enable a way to increase the ammo you carry by picking up additional Ammo Expansion Packs. Upon picking up subsequent Packs after the first, your ammo capacities will increase by the non-backpack ammo values multiplied by the percentage value of 'Increasing Ammo Capacity Percentage'. For example, using the default values, picking up two Ammo Expansion Packs with the percentage set to 10% will set the default ammo values to to 420/210/105/630. This setting is disabled by default." },
		{ "Increasing Ammo Capacity Percentage", "This setting determines the percentage of the upgraded ammo capacity that will accumulate after picking up Ammo Expansion Packs if 'Increasing Ammo Capacities' is enabled. Setting the value to 100% will effectively double the ammo capacities with every Ammo Expansion Pack picked up." },
		{ "Increasing Ammo Capacity Limit", "This setting determines if there should be a limit on the amount of times the 'Increasing Ammo Capacities' setting can be applied. For example, setting this option to 10 will limit the amount of increasing Ammo Expansion Packs to 10. If this setting is at 0, then it will have no effect. If it is at -1, then there will be no limit to the amount of times the ammo capacities can be upgraded. Note that the first Ammo Expansion Pack does not count towards the limit." },

		{ "Chex Quest: LAZ Device Mode", "The LAZ Device in Chex Quest was just a reskinned BFG, but Samsara spices things up for the LAZ Device to make the Chex Warrior stand out more compared to Doomguy. With this set to 'Modern', the LAZ device will function as a shield that can be held down with the primary fire button, and released to launch the projectile. The projectile's impact does residual damage to nearby enemies, but it doesn't do any BFG tracers like the BFG9000. Setting it to 'Classic' will have it work just like in Chex Quest, with it being a clone of Doom's BFG9000." },

		{ "Quake I: Quad Damage Behavior", "When Ranger picks up a Slot VII, he will receive a powerup that makes him deal four times as much damage in 30 seconds. This setting chooses between two different ways his Quad Damage is handled. If it's set to 'Q1 Style', then Ranger will need to get another Slot VII in order to get Quad Damage again, with successive pickups adding to the powerup timer should he already be in effect of one. If it's set to 'Q2-ish Style', then Ranger won't be able to collect another Quad Damage if he's in effect of one or if he already picked up a Slot VII. Instead, it will be an inventory item that has to recharge before being usable again." },

		{ "ROTT: Ban God/Dog Mode", "When Ian Paul Freeley or any of the ROTT altclasses picks up an invulnerability powerup, they will get either the God Mode or Dog Mode powerup. If this setting is enabled, ROTT characters will get the regular invulnerability powerup like most of the other characters." },

		{ "Blood: Guns Akimbo Behavior", "Caleb's known for many things, but one of his traits is his expert gunslinging abilities. This setting determines how the Guns Akimbo powerup will behave. The options are:\n\n\cjPowerup: \cmCaleb will immediately be able to dual wield for a limited amount of time upon picking up a unique. This is the default setting, and it is the recommended setting for competitive game modes.\n\n\cjInventory (Single Use): \cmCaleb will store the Guns Akimbo powerup in his inventory for later use. Upon using it, it will be removed from the inventory.\n\n\cjInventory (Cooldown): \cmThis setting is identical to the Inventory (Single Use) setting, except that the Guns Akimbo powerup will not be removed from the inventory on use, with a cooldown being given instead.\n\n\cjToggle: \cmCaleb can dual wield his guns at any point as long as he wants by pressing either Class Special key without having to pick up a unique. Picking up a unique will instead give a quadruple damage boost." },

		{ "Half-Life: Explosive Crossbow Bolts", "This setting determines whether the Half-Life characters' crossbow bolts should explode when hitting map geometry." },
		{ "Painkiller: No Demon Morph", "By default, Daniel Garner will turn into a demon when he collects 66 souls from enemies. If this setting is turned on, Daniel won't turn into a demon." },
		{ "Painkiller: No Tarot Card Limit", "Daniel Garner has access to special tarot cards that activate various powers for him, such as increased damage or health regeneration. The cards have a default limit of three uses per level, but if this setting is turned on, the player will be able to use the cards as much as they want." },
		{ "Painkiller: No Corpse Removal", "When Daniel Garner kills an organic enemy, the corpse will dissappear into a puff of smoke and a soul will appear for Daniel to collect along with some gold drops. By default, this behavior is enabled to match Painkiller's gameplay, but if desired, it can be disabled, making the corpse stay in the level after death while having souls and gold continue to spawn. If the setting is enabled, Archviles can resurrect enemies since they have corpses left behind, but enemies killed again won't drop additional souls or gold. Note that this setting doesn't affect Freezer kills, since there isn't a corpse to remove." },
		{ "Descent: Pyro-GX Flight", "One of Pyro-GX's most unique features is the special movement that allows the player to fly at any direction they choose, and in GZDoom only, to rotate their character anyway they choose to. Because of how easily maps can be bypassed with this setting, it can be turned off if the player chooses to, but the setting is on by default. Keep in mind however, that like in the source game, players can get motion sickness from the Pyro-GX's movement if this setting is set to 'On (Advanced)' in GZDoom!" },
		{ "Deus Ex: Movement Penalties", "In Deus Ex, heavier weapons like the GEP gun would slow the player down unless they had a high level of heavy weapons skill. This feature was brought to Samsara, but by default, it is turned off in order to make JC Denton better suited for Samsara's style of combat. In competitive gamemodes, the movement penalties are disabled regardless of setting." },
		{ "Ban Flight Items", "If this option is enabled, characters will not be able to use certain items that could sequence break maps. Duke and LDF Commando's jetpacks will no longer be usable with this option enabled, and Grondoval won't be able to use his flight spell.

This item can allow them to call for backup and bring their allies from their respective games with them to fight alongside the player. If the player wishes, they could disable this setting for cooperative gamemodes, forcing them to fight without the ability to receive the item. Note that this setting is always activated in competitive gamemodes." },
		{ "Custom Gravity", "Some classes have their own custom gravity matching their games like the Security Officer. This option can disable the feature and make them use the same style of gravity as Doom's." },
		{ "Force Weapon Recoil", "The 'Weapon Recoil' clientside option allows players to disable vertical weapon recoil, but this setting can force it on. Note that if freelook is disabled in the server, this setting will not work as weapon recoil will be entirely disabled. Highly recommended for competitive gamemodes to prevent players from gaining an advantage." },
		{ "Proximity Explosive Behavior", "Certain weapons like Caleb's Proximity Detonator have a special property for their projectiles to activate with enemies that get close to them, but not for the player depending on this setting. The default setting, 'Ignores Owners' will make it so players won't trigger their own proximity explosives unless an enemy is nearby. The other setting, 'Activates For Owners', has the explosives activate whenever the player gets close by." },
		{ "Character Ban and Multiplier Options", "Is a certain class too overpowered or underpowered? Do you want everyone but Space Seal allowed on your server? These options can not only alter the damage given and taken for a class and/or any of its alt-classes, but if desired, they can be banned entirely from the server. The settings affect everyone using the class, so if Doomguy was given buffs, then every Doomguy player will receive buffs as well. The modifiers work on a scale, so for example, setting the Security Officer's defense modifier to '2x' will make him take half as much damage, while setting Eleena's damage multiplier to '2x' will make her deal twice as much damage.

This means that there are no enemies from altclasses, extra enemy features, or other enhancements.\n\n\cjSamsara: \cmThis setting is similar to the 'Vanilla' preset, only with a few changes like additional enemy behavior and difficulty scaling.\n\n\cjSamsara Reincarnation: \cmThis is the default preset and is recommended for newcomers to Samsara Reincarnation. This preset is similar to the 'Samsara' preset, with additional enemies being selectable for spawning." },

		{ "Ghost Mode", "This determines how many monsters in the map should become ghosts. Ghosts are translucent, and certain weapons will be unable to damage them. They are otherwise identical to their regular counterparts, and the default setting is to disable them entirely, but they can be found in Heretic and Hexen: Beyond Heretic regardless of the setting." },
		{ "Flight Mode", "This setting controls how many monsters are given the ability to fly like Lost Souls or Cacodemons. The setting is turned off by default." },
		{ "Infighting Mode", "Normally, monsters are able to fight amongst themselves if they manage to hurt one another, although there are rules on how monsters are able to infight. For example, projectiles spawned from an Imp can't hurt other Imps, but they can hurt other monsters and instigate infighting. Hitscanners like Zombiemen will always be able to infight against other monsters including themselves, and in Remixer, many sets have monsters that won't infight at all. The 'Infighting Mode' setting allows the player to determine the infighting rules for all monsters in the level. The options are:\n\n\cjForce Disabled Infighting: \cmThis setting will prevent every monster from infighting with each other. Hitscanners and monsters with explosive projectiles can still hurt fellow monsters, but they will never turn against each other.\n\n\cjOff: \cmThis is the default setting, which follows the normal infighting hierarchy and rules.\n\n\cjForce Enabled Infighting: \cmThis allows every monster to hurt and fight each other if provoked, even from projectiles launched by the same monster type." },
		{ "Performance Mode", "Using ReMixer can be very resource-heavy, especially with more complex sets like Half-Life or GoldenEye 007. By default, this setting is enabled, allowing enemies to spawn only when the player gets close enough to them or otherwise awaken them. This allows the enemies to spawn much like how they would normally without putting too much stress on performance. However, the system isn't perfect and it can prevent some enemies from spawning if they are in an area like a faraway monster closet. As such, this system can be disabled to ensure monster spawning or if the player has good enough performance to handle the more intense sets." },
		{ "Spawn Mode", "This changes how enemies are spawned in the map. Your options are:\n\n\cjClass-Based: \cmThis option enables enemies from the current class being played to be spawned. For example, selecting Kyle Katarn will enable Dark Forces enemies to be spawned. Multiple classes in a multiplayer session will enable each enemy to be selected from the played classes.\n\n\cjEntire Sets: \cmThis setting will make every enemy spawn from the selected sets on the Monster Spawn Options. This is similar to how mods such as Aeons Of Death spawned their enemies.\n\n\cjRandom Cycle: \cmThis option chooses from the selected sets on the Monster Spawn Options and make every enemy spawn from that set. This is similar to how mods such as Quake Champions: Doom Edition spawn their enemies." },

		{ "Enemy Drop Mode", "By default, enemies will only drop their weapons if they did so in their base game. However, setting this to 'Doom-Style' makes any Shotgun Guy and Chaingun Guy replacement drop Slot IIs and Slot IVs respectively. This setting doesn't affect any sets with enemies that already drop their weapons frequently such as Goldeneye." },
		{ "Monster Multiplier", "This party mode enables monsters to spawn duplicates of itself according to the value on this setting. This can make multiplayer sessions much more chaotic, but it can also be taxing on both the server and the system performance." },
		{ "Monster Generation Rate", "Do you feel like there's not enough enemies in a level? This setting will enable additional monsters to spawn on a level, with the settings controlling how much is spawned per level. The generator works on a curve that looks at the number of different monsters, and tries to spawn those with similar strength to the map's original monsters. For example, if a monster has many pinky demons in it, the generator will try to spawn monsters that complement the demons such as Zombiemen or Imps. There are many settings to chose from, but it's recommended to stay within the lower values of the generator." },
		{ "Monster Reducer Rate", "Some sets like Duke Nukem 3D have enemies that are more dangerous than Doom's demons or Heretic's ghouls. This setting can let the user choose if certain enemies in a map don't spawn based on their location and selected monster set. For example, on the default setting, Doom monsters will always spawn based on their location, while Half-Life enemies might have a chance to not show up. There are multiple settings that can increase or decrease the reduction rate, so if it's set to 'Very High Reduction', then Doom monsters may not show up, while setting it to 'No Reduction' will always have Half-Life enemies spawn." },

		{ "Wolfenstein 3D: Quick Fake Hitler Fire", "The fake Hitler ghosts fired projectiles that had speeds dependent on the user's computer and its processing power. Normally, the projectiles move quickly in Samsara, but if this setting is disabled, this makes the projectiles move more slowly like how they did back in 1992-era computers." },

By default, Marathon explosions from enemies deal full damage as long as they are caught in the blast radius, mimicking Marathon behavior. This setting can be disabled if Doom-like behavior is desired for the explosions instead." },
		{ "Quake I: Instant Zombie Deaths", "Zombies in Quake I can only be killed by gibbing them, but in Samsara, they can also be slain after falling and getting up, allowing for players with limited explosives to dispatch them. This setting determines if the Zombies gib instantly after dying just once, or if they need to get up before becoming gibbable." },
		{ "Redneck Rampage: Cuss Pack", "This setting controls whether Redneck Rampage enemies use the sounds from the regular game, the Cuss Pack addon, or a mix of both sources. Note that the setting doesn't apply until the next level or game." },
		{ "GoldenEye 007: Corpse Hitboxes", "If this setting is enabled, then GoldenEye enemies can continue to get shot for a short time after dying. The hitboxes block projectiles from both players and enemies, and they can potentially shield both parties. This behavior is the default setting, but if desired, it can be turned off." },
		{ "GoldenEye 007: Corpse Persistence", "In GoldenEye 007, killed enemies disappear after a few seconds. This setting determines if they also disappear in Samsara or if they stay opaque after playing their death animations." },
		{ "Enemy Modes", "These modes change the behavior of spawns of a single set, allowing different enemies to spawn from a choice of settings. 'Class-Based' chooses the enemies from the selected class, but the rest of the options are self-explanatory as they are game-specific." },
