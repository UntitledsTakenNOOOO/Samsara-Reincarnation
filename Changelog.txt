! Widescreen sprites for Timon's Axe and the Hammer of Retribution (made by SuperDave938) have been implemented.
+ Originally an instagib weapon, the Bloodscourge has been added as the slot 7S weapon! Compared to Daedolon's version, it has a slower rate of fire, and the projectiles trade damage and homing capability for speed and forced splash damage against bosses.

* The slot 7 pickup now properly checks for both Ammo 1 and Ammo 4.
+ The mystic ambit incant, disc of repulsion, and dark servant are now usable by anyone instead of being locked to their respective characters, serving as the first, second, and third uniques, respectively. The mystic ambit incant also behaves differently depending on who uses it (Parias (Reincarnation) gives health, Parias (Classic) focuses on health while giving armor on the side, Daedolon gives ammo, and Baratus gives armor).
* Fixed the mystic ambit incant not checking for the health/ammo/armor of allies in range.

+ The Tech.50 Pacifier has been brought back from the removed punchdrunk mode and made into a backpack support weapon! This handgun not only stuns enemies like in previous versions of Samsara, but it now has an alternate attack that overcharges the Pacifier to dangerously lethal levels, causing killed humanoid enemies to burn into charcoal like the TOZT-7!

Ranger (Quake I):

* The regeneration decay from megaspheres now stops at or below 100 health instead of just below.

- Heatseeker and Bazooka have swapped positions and ammo types.
- RoTT Bullets deal their original damage values instead of Doom ones (13 for the pistols, 10 for the MP40)
- RoTT Missiles deal their original damage of 50, with some exceptions (Drunk Missiles only do 25, and most rockets have contact damage in SP and Coop modes.)

Blake Stone:

- Added an Aliens of Gold alt class.
- Heavy Assault Weapon works differently, more like an autmatic shotgun. Also, it uses Slow-Fire Protector firing sounds.

- Most Blake Stone weapons deal higher damage. For example, instead of the RAW dealing 6 1d3 damage, it now deals 7 1d3.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon now spawn explosive effects on enemies effected by the blast. These effects are damaging, making these two weapons somewhat akin to the BFG9000 from Doom.
- Plasma Discharge Unit consumes only 1 rocket instead of 2.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon had their Rate of Fire greatly increased. However, the Plasma Discharge suffered a significant range and damage decrease and the Anti-Plasma Cannon is rather innaccurate.
- The Charge Pack was moved to unique slot, while the Slot 1 is now an Auto-Charge Pistol upgrade. Xylan Orb was commented out due to not being very helpful, and not making sense for a "Skirmisher" character.
- Blake Stone gains slightly more ammo from ammo pickups

Doom64Guy:

- Is now an Altclass
- Vanilla Doom CVar has the same effect on Doom64Guy's weapon damage, although Plasma Rifle and SSG are still unaffected. Although there are no Smooth firing animations for Doom 64 guns yet, there eventually will be.

- Added an option for Guns Akimbo to be permanent and activated at the push of a button.

- Flaregun primary now deals about 42 damage over the course of its lifetime instead of 70.
- TNT Bundles control like they did in Blood. Primary hold and release throws the TNT, Secondary ignites the fuse.

- Blood Explosions have a rapidly expanding sphere of radius thrust. In other words, they have a lot more knock-back.
- Sawed-Off, Tommy Gun, and Life Leech Sentry now fire faster.
- Sawed-Off is now significantly more accurate and fires 15 pellets per barrel rather than 10. Each pellet deals 5 damage for a total of 75 damage per barrel, instead of dealing about the same damage as the Super Shotgun.
- Tommy Gun deals 9 damage per shot instead of 2-4 1d3
- Napalm Rockets do 50-100 damage plus 200 damage across a radius of 150, instead 10-12 plus 82 damage over a radius of 160.

StrifeGuy:

- Added Blackbird radio chatter in the form of taunts
- Implemented the Gas Grenades that were cut from the final product. They work similarly to White Phosphorus grenades, but deal poison damage and don't creep slowly around surfaces. The damage output is very high, even higher than WP grenades, but they cannot effect robots and deal half-damage to cyborgs and creatures made of slime.
- Buffed Mini-Missiles to deal 50% more explosion damage and an impact deals a solid 40 damage in addition to the explosion.

- Electric Crossbow, Flamethrower, and Mauler deal double damage.
- Bullets deal 4 1d3 damage, true to source. The Pistol shoots much faster.
- Poison Bolts deal 50 1d4 damage to enemies it can effect, allowing it to pick up the slack when Strifeguy runs out of rockets.
- Electric Bolts now deal double damage to all Robotic, Cybernetic, or Vehicular enemies across the entire monster mixer. Enemies made of slime or liquid, such as the Muck Demoness from Witchaven, also take double damage. Robotic and Vehicular enemies, as well as ghostly enemies and enemies made of stone, are immune to poison bolts. Cyborg enemies take half damage from Poison Bolts.
- Strife weapons are overall much more accurate, making accuracy upgrades feel more impactful when you get them.
- Strife Flamethrower increases range with more accuracy upgrades.
- Strife Flamethrower has half the recoil and the fireballs shoot more straight at higher accuracies rather than lobbing further
- Strife Sigil's 4th mode (the homing one) now fires 5 homing shots at once

- fixed the Thermal Detonators generating blood decals on their own

Space Seal:

- Mines can blow up their user in DM, but are also shootable
- Mines can be destroyed with explosives in all game modes
- Space Seal's weapons deal slightly higher damage in DM, as Corridor 7 was one of the first games to have dedicated Deathmatch mode with it own maps, predating Rise of the Triad by a few months. Made sense knowing this fun fact to have Space Seal be the dedicated DM beginner class.
- The Alien Plasma Rifle increases in damage as the projectile travels, and on a direct hit the damage, whatever it is, is dealt in full.
- Alien Plasma Rifle fires slightly slower and only consumes 1 rocket instead of 2.
- The screen briefly flashes red when the Alien Disintigrator is fired.
- Alien Disintegrator now fires up to 100 tracers at 16 damage each, slightly improving its killing power at mid range
- all C7-related projectile actors have NODAMAGETHRUST, knockback wasn't a thing in the Wolf 3d engine
- all C7 bullet weapons deal higher damage at closer ranges, with the possible damage either doubling or tripling at point blank. However, damage is heavily randomized and very inconsistent. Space Seal is the closest to an "authentic" Wolf 3d-style damage system. BJ's weapon damage increases in close range as well, but only slightly.

LDF Commando:

- Class was almost completely overhauled. All projectiles use the same speed values from source, so they are lightning fast. Projectile damage also uses the same values from source, but most had to be either doubled or increased slightly due to the extremely low damage scale.
- LDF Commando now starts with 50 clips.

- Toxic Mutant Gun is no longer the slot 1, instead being Experiment's starting pistol. The slot 1 is now another random item generator (for now.)

* Note 1: Punchdrunk isnt made yet because im out of time.

* Note 2: Im trying to fill every missing thing, so i wish that this
		  wont feel incomplete anymore. (Please, check Note 1*)

* Note 3: I hope that this is compatible with Hexen & Strife (wew) now.  
 
* Note 4: The Eradicator addon could have a lot of better effects & visual things, but some of the required graphics 
		  were just impossible to rip.
	
* Note 5: Tipboxes for Strifeguy and Eleena will be included in the next version of this.

* Note 6: If something isnt working well, please let me know! (Any feedback will be appreciated too!)
