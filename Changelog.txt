* Fixed the projectiles from the banishment item not going through allies in PVE.
* Fixed the random powerup leaving behind invisible dummy powerups.
! Various powerups no longer have +BIGPOWERUP.
* Equipment pickups (except for uniques) spawned via ACS or summon cheats are no longer treated as if they were dropped by enemies, meaning they give the proper amount of ammo on pickup (instead of just half). They can still only be picked up one time.
* Equipment pickups should now calculate given ammo more accurately on first pickup in PVP gamemodes when playing Doom or Chex Quest.
* Non-unique equipment pickups should now calculate given ammo more accurately when dropped by actors.
! Pickup messages are now separate for most slots with more than one weapon. Print pickup will only show the latest message, however.

* Ammo expansion packs now properly prioritize increasing the ammo capacities before giving ammo when using non-default cap amounts. (Currently only applies to pickups, however. Behavior is still bugged with keyboard cheats.)

- Removed the detailed weapon info in the Compendium. In the future, this will be replaced by a more intuitive interface that uses graphics to represent weapon info instead of using numerical values.
! Added "clearskills" to MAPINFO, which prevents the LZDoom-exclusive difficulty from appearing and should add compatibility with more total conversions.
! Removed the Samsara-specific key replacers. Recent versions of Zandronum are able to handle key sharing between players, which makes the key replacers redundant. This also had the side-effect of restoring compatibility with the Skulltag gamemode.
! Added the previously-removed winner and loser team screens from older versions of Samsara.
* Fixed the ally cell phone progress not incrementing every thousandth kill.
* Fixed the ally cell phone being droppable.
! Any slot 7 equipment, unique equipment, and partial invisibility powerups that are dropped by enemies now obey the "Replace Slot 7 Equipment", "Replace Unique Equipment", and "Replace Partial Invisibility" settings, respectively.
+ Added scoreboard icons for every class.
+ All of the textcolors made by FuzzBallFox for Zandronum have been merged, allowing them to be used in GZDoom/LZDoom.

! Attacks with the FireExplosive damage type can now gib actors again (1/2 chance; jump check starts at -101 health due to limitations).

* Morphed players should now go through allies more reliably.
+ Added a console background graphic.
* For GZDoom, player colors now show up properly (or at least as close to properly as possible) in different IWADs. Separate patches will still need to be used for Zandronum.
! Changed skill 4 (NM equivalent) to increase monster health instead of damage, because nobody likes getting one-shot from across the map.
* A new, less desync-prone method for making actors solid/non-solid is now used.
* Weapon attacks that use A_Quake for visual recoil no longer interrupt player jumping sounds.
* NOPAIN and NODAMAGE are now removed from shrinking players on map change and after the effect expires.

- Buffed Ranger's shotgun and double shotgun to deal 5 damage per pellet (30 total for single shotgun, 70 total for Double)

- Ranger's weapons are buffed in SP rather than Coop. If you're playing alone, you would need a damage buff more than you would in Coop.

- Heatseeker and Bazooka have swapped positions and ammo types.
- RoTT Bullets deal their original damage values instead of Doom ones (13 for the pistols, 10 for the MP40)
- RoTT Missiles deal their original damage of 50, with some exceptions (Drunk Missiles only do 25, and most rockets have contact damage in SP and Coop modes.)

Blake Stone:

- Added an Aliens of Gold alt class.

- Most Blake Stone weapons deal higher damage. For example, instead of the RAW dealing 6 1d3 damage, it now deals 7 1d3.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon now spawn explosive effects on enemies effected by the blast. These effects are damaging, making these two weapons somewhat akin to the BFG9000 from Doom.
- Plasma Discharge Unit consumes only 1 rocket instead of 2.
- Plasma Discharge Unit and Anti-Plasma Cannon had their Rate of Fire greatly increased. However, the Plasma Discharge suffered a significant range and damage decrease and the Anti-Plasma Cannon is rather innaccurate.
- The Charge Pack was moved to unique slot, while the Slot 1 is now an Auto-Charge Pistol upgrade. Xylan Orb was commented out due to not being very helpful, and not making sense for a "Skirmisher" character.
- Blake Stone gains slightly more ammo from ammo pickups

Doom64Guy:

- Is now an Altclass
- Vanilla Doom CVar has the same effect on Doom64Guy's weapon damage, although Plasma Rifle and SSG are still unaffected. Although there are no Smooth firing animations for Doom 64 guns yet, there eventually will be.

- Added an option for Guns Akimbo to be permanent and activated at the push of a button.
- All weapons use different damage values, thanks to the NBlood source code. Some of these damage values were tweaked, however.

- Flaregun primary now deals about 42 damage over the course of its lifetime instead of 70.
- TNT Bundles control like they did in Blood. Primary hold and release throws the TNT, Secondary ignites the fuse.

- Blood Explosions have a rapidly expanding sphere of radius thrust. In other words, they have a lot more knock-back.
- Sawed-Off, Tommy Gun, and Life Leech Sentry now fire faster.

- Tommy Gun deals 9 damage per shot instead of 2-4 1d3
- Napalm Rockets do 50-100 damage plus 200 damage across a radius of 150, instead 10-12 plus 82 damage over a radius of 160.

StrifeGuy:

- Added Blackbird radio chatter in the form of taunts
- Implemented the Gas Grenades that were cut from the final product. They work similarly to White Phosphorus grenades, but deal poison damage and don't creep slowly around surfaces. The damage output is very high, even higher than WP grenades, but they cannot effect robots and deal half-damage to cyborgs and creatures made of slime.
- Buffed Mini-Missiles to deal 50% more explosion damage and an impact deals a solid 40 damage in addition to the explosion.

- Electric Crossbow, Flamethrower, and Mauler deal double damage.

- Poison Bolts deal 50 1d4 damage to enemies it can effect, allowing it to pick up the slack when Strifeguy runs out of rockets.
- Electric Bolts now deal double damage to all Robotic, Cybernetic, or Vehicular enemies across the entire monster mixer. Enemies made of slime or liquid, such as the Muck Demoness from Witchaven, also take double damage. Robotic and Vehicular enemies, as well as ghostly enemies and enemies made of stone, are immune to poison bolts. Cyborg enemies take half damage from Poison Bolts.
- Strife weapons are overall much more accurate, making accuracy upgrades feel more impactful when you get them.
- Strife Flamethrower increases range with more accuracy upgrades.
- Strife Flamethrower has half the recoil and the fireballs shoot more straight at higher accuracies rather than lobbing further
- Strife Sigil's 4th mode (the homing one) now fires 5 homing shots at once

- fixed the Thermal Detonators generating blood decals on their own

Space Seal:

- Mines can blow up their user in DM, but are also shootable
- Mines can be destroyed with explosives in all game modes
- Space Seal's weapons deal slightly higher damage in DM, as Corridor 7 was one of the first games to have dedicated Deathmatch mode with it own maps, predating Rise of the Triad by a few months. Made sense knowing this fun fact to have Space Seal be the dedicated DM beginner class.
- The Alien Plasma Rifle increases in damage as the projectile travels, and on a direct hit the damage, whatever it is, is dealt in full.
- Alien Plasma Rifle fires slightly slower and only consumes 1 rocket instead of 2.
- The screen briefly flashes red when the Alien Disintigrator is fired.
- Alien Disintegrator now fires up to 100 tracers at 16 damage each, slightly improving its killing power at mid range
- all C7-related projectile actors have NODAMAGETHRUST, knockback wasn't a thing in the Wolf 3d engine
- all C7 bullet weapons deal higher damage at closer ranges, with the possible damage either doubling or tripling at point blank. However, damage is heavily randomized and very inconsistent. Space Seal is the closest to an "authentic" Wolf 3d-style damage system. BJ's weapon damage increases in close range as well, but only slightly.

LDF Commando:

- Class was almost completely overhauled. All projectiles use the same speed values from source, so they are lightning fast. Projectile damage also uses the same values from source, but most had to be either doubled or increased slightly due to the extremely low damage scale.
- LDF Commando now starts with 50 clips.

- Plasma Annihilator now deals 200 damage per beam instead of 180.

* Note 3: I hope that this is compatible with Hexen & Strife (wew) now.

		  were just impossible to rip.

* Note 6: If something isnt working well, please let me know! (Any feedback will be appreciated too!)
